# ec2-manager

## This is the EC2 Manager, a boto3 script that is designed to change the state of one's available EC2 instances.

The EC2 manager allows you to interact with your AWS EC2 instances in an easy way via the CLI instead of having to take multiple actions inside the AWS Management Console. The EC2 manager specifically allows you to:

* Describe your instances
* Start an instance
* Stop an instance
* Reboot an instance 
* Terminate an instance
